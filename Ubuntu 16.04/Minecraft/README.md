# Ubuntu 16-04 Scripts - Minecraft

This folder is for the scripts that I use when deploying a minecraft server.

If you need a script here or you think you have a script that may help others, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LochStudios/Ubuntu-16-04-Scripts/issues/new) and include it.

To download and install any of the servers run:

* wget -O- https://lochstudios.rocks/Minecraft/Vanilla/vanilla.sh | bash
